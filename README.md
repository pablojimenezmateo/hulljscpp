# hulljscpp

This is a c++ port of the JS library [hull.js](https://github.com/AndriiHeonia/hull), 1.0.3 — 05.11.2022.

**Note:** This is not a complete port as [format.js](https://github.com/AndriiHeonia/hull/blob/master/src/format.js) has not been ported.


It also comes with bindings and an example on how to execute it from Python.

```

## Python
